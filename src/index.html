    <h1>Force directed "not quite a tree" network</h1>
    <p>
        Nodes are connected in a d3 tree network, but with some hacking to allow cycles (so not a tree...).
    </p>
    <p>
        Nodes are dynamic along vertical "depth" axes, but static in the x-direction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Double click to toggle the fixing of node position.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hovering over nodes highlights paths to (solid) and from (dashed) the node.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hovering over arcs/links/paths (depending on nomenclature) highlights the start node (green) and the end node (red).
    </p>
